# ESPRESSObin Case

A case for the [ESPRESSObin board](https://www.amazon.com/ESPRESSObin-SBUD102-Single-Computer-Network/dp/B06Y3V2FBK
), designed for FFF/DM-based 3D printing without supports.

Printing Notes: The idle temperature of the ESPRESSObin is quite warm (around ~53C in certain areas). Please consider printing this case in something like PETG (which has a higher glass transition temperature than PLA and flame-retardant/self-extinguishing properties).

Update 4: There is now a version of the case (espressobin-f2-base-heatsinkable.stl) that has room for a small heatsink on the processor.

Print the case and feet/legs in PETG, then print the covers in TPU if desired. The case may tilt a bit (even with the TPU covers), so cabling will need to be routed appropriately.

Upcoming additions/changes (as time permits):

* Adding different lid configurations for GPIO/SATA access (editable source is provided as espressobin_case.stp for custom modifications)

# Print Settings

Printer: Prusa i3 MK2
Resolution: 0.2mm

Notes:
Printed using Prusa3D's 0.2mm Slic3r settings and stock PETG settings.

Materials used:
Bottom case: Ultibots 1.75mm Black PETG
Top cover: MadeSolid 1.75mm Ruby Red PET+ (with ~+10C on hotend)
Legs: Ultibots 1.75mm Black PETG
Leg covers: Ninjaflex 1.75mm Snow White

# Previous Updates

Update 3: Version f2 moves all of the feet closer to the edges, making the case harder to  tip. As with the standoff edition, the PCB is also up and away from the plastic.

Update 2: A new version that supports feet/legs is up. The lid remains compatible with both versions, but this adds extra support for the switch port partitions and printable slide on feet/legs (very helpful to ensure the bottom doesn't get too hot/gets air flow).

Print the case and feet/legs in PETG, then print the covers in TPU if desired. The case has a tendency to tilt a bit (even with the TPU covers), so cabling will need to be more carefully routed with this version.

Update 1: This case is now mostly finalized, and ready for general use. The old version has been removed, and the new one is up now. In addition, an extra 'labeled' cover has been added with topside port labels.
