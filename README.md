# ESPRESSObin Case

# Summary

An alternative case for the [ESPRESSObin board](https://www.amazon.com/ESPRESSObin-SBUD102-Single-Computer-Network/dp/B06Y3V2FBK
), designed for FFF/DM-based 3D printing without supports.

Printing Notes: The idle temperature of the ESPRESSObin is quite warm (around ~53C in certain areas). Please consider printing this case in something like PETG (which has a higher glass transition temperature than PLA and flame-retardant/self-extinguishing properties).

6/30/2017: This case is now mostly finalized, and ready for general use. The old version has been removed, and the new one is up now. In addition, an extra 'labeled' cover has been added with topside port labels.

Upcoming additions/changes (as time permits):

* Adding different lid configurations for GPIO/SATA access (editable source is provided as espressobin_case.stp for custom modifications)
* TPU feet
